# Output variables: 

These are variables that are defined in the Terraform configuration and are used to output the attributes of resources and modules, such as IP addresses and DNS names. Output variables can be used to pass values to other Terraform configurations or to other tools.

The syntax for defining an output is as follows:

output "OUTPUT_NAME" {
  value = "OUTPUT_VALUE"
}
"OUTPUT_NAME" is the name of the output, which should be unique within the Terraform configuration.
"OUTPUT_VALUE" is the value of the output, which can be any valid Terraform expression.


For example, an output that displays the public IP address of an AWS EC2 instance:

output "ip_address" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
