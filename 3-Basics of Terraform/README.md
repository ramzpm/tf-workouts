Here are some basic concepts of Terraform:

- Terraform CLI
- Resources
- Variables
- Outputs 
- Providers
- State Management
- Modules

## Terraform CLI: 

The Terraform Command Line Interface (CLI) is the tool used to create, update, and delete infrastructure. The most common commands include "terraform init" to initialize a Terraform configuration, "terraform plan" to preview the changes that will be made, and "terraform apply" to create or update the infrastructure.

## Resources:

 Terraform uses a declarative syntax to describe the desired state of the infrastructure. Resources are the basic building blocks of Terraform and are used to create, update and delete infrastructure components such as servers, load balancers, and databases.

 ## Variables: 
 
 Terraform uses variables to make the configuration more flexible and reusable. Variables can be defined in the Terraform configuration and can be used to pass values to the resources and modules.

## Outputs: 

Terraform allows to output the attributes of resources and modules, such as IP addresses and DNS names. Outputs can be used to pass values to other Terraform configurations or to other tools.

## Providers: 

Terraform supports many different infrastructure providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as open-source tools like OpenStack and VMWare. Providers are used to interact with the specific APIs of the infrastructure provider to create, update, and delete resources.

## State Management: 

Terraform maintains a state file that keeps track of the current state of the infrastructure. This state file is used to determine what actions need to be taken to bring the infrastructure to the desired state described in the Terraform configuration files.

## Modules: 

Terraform modules are reusable units of Terraform configuration that can be shared and composed to create more complex infrastructure. They allow to organize the Terraform code and make it more readable and maintainable.
