# State management in Terraform

Terraform state management is the process of keeping track of the current state of the infrastructure that Terraform manages. Terraform uses a state file, which is a JSON file that keeps track of the resources that have been created and their current properties.

When you run the terraform apply command, Terraform compares the current state of the resources in the state file to the desired state defined in the Terraform configuration files. If there are any differences, Terraform will make the necessary changes to the infrastructure to bring it to the desired state. The updated state is then stored in the state file.

There are different ways to manage the state file, here are a few:

- Local state file: By default, Terraform stores the state file in the local filesystem. This is the simplest way to manage the state, but it can become a problem when working in a team or when using multiple machines.

- Remote state: Terraform supports storing the state file on a remote backend, such as S3 or Azure Storage. This allows teams to share the state file and ensures that the state is consistent across all machines.

- Locking state: When working with a remote state, Terraform provides state locking to prevent multiple users from making conflicting changes to the state file at the same time.

- State import: Terraform allows you to import existing resources into the state file, this is useful when you have existing resources that you want to manage with Terraform.

- State migration: Terraform also allows to migrate the state from one backend to another, this can be useful when you change the backend storage or when you want to split the state into multiple files.
